# Ripoti Taka: A Web Application to Mobilize Citizen Participation in Solid Waste Management in Nairobi

# Introduction
Solid waste management in Nairobi County faces challenges such as inadequate coverage, uncontrolled dumping, inefficient services, and lack of infrastructure, leading to health risks and environmental damage. Limited public participation has shown potential in improving the situation. This project aims to develop "Ripoti Taka," a web platform for citizens to monitor and report waste management issues using geotagged reports with descriptions and visual evidence. Utilizing ArchGIS, Leaflet JS, and Flask, the system creates interactive maps to identify problem areas, promoting sustainable waste management. This project could transform waste management in Nairobi and serve as a national model.
